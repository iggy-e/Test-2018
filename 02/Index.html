            <h1>Hito Steryerl</h1>
            <p class="header">hito steryerl is a visual film and new media artist with a high interest in technology as well as what happens due to the circulation of images. </p>

            <div class="A">
                <p class="main">Possibly what is Hito steryerl's most renowned piece is <b><i>Factory of the sun</i></b> a full room installation that not only lets viewers look at the piece but also be apart of it as the viewing is set in a room ripped straight out of <i>Tron</i>.The work takes on multiple forms as documentaries, news broadcasts and a videogames. <b><i>Factory of the Sun</i></b> although highly interesting with its clear influences from pop cultre and 3D visuals doesn't offer a very clear explination as to what the work itself was made for, leaving much of it's interpretation up to those viewing the piece.</p>

                I think both the mystery of the pieces purpose and its inclusion of pop culture is what makes this piece work so well. It's weird like many artistic works but the inclusion of iconic imagery from pop culture makes it so the work doesn't feel so far removed from the viewer. Typically artists stay away from modern pop imagery for many reasons, the biggest reason being the artistic standard that such things can't be high art.

                I think <b><i>Factory of the Sun</i></b> is highly successful because it embodies the internet culture it came from, rather than trying to make up all of it's source material, it makes its narrative by pulling from it and shaping it, such as it's viral aspects, into part of it's story making into something more reminicent of general internet culture rather than trying to make it into high art.
