        <h2>Days in Gifs</h2>
        <p>My Data Diary is a collection of gifs with small blurbs about why they're relevant. Each one means something small but signifigant that happened on that day. I usually like using gif's to express how i feel on social media so i thought it would be fun to put it in a short journal context and see how my week went at a glance.</p>
